# SB-PdM-a-tool-for-predictive-maintenance-of-rolling-bearings-based-on-limited-labeled-data
SB-PdM is  a non-machine learning code to perform Predictive Maintenance (PdM) of rolling bearings without the need to train a classifier. In SM-PdM, the classification task is performed by applying a similarity measure between test sample and class-reference labeled samples in the feature space.
